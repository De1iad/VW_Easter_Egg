# 42Wolfsburg_VW_EasterEgg
This project applies the use of the fast fourier transform algorithm to transform audio samples from sound file (.wav) to a frequency spectrum which is then mapped to variables to control the lights of a car.

## Using the program
The program in the directory ```create_light_file/``` will create a file containing light variables for use in the program in the ```vw_play/``` directory.
The ```vw_play/``` directory contains a program that utilises 42 minilibx to model the changes in the light variables of the car.
