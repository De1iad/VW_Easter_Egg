# 42Wolfsburg_VW_EasterEgg
This project applies the use of the fast fourier transform algorithm to transform audio samples from sound file (.wav) to a frequency spectrum which is then mapped to variables to control the lights of a car.

## Create Light File
This program will create a file containing light variables for use in the car_demo program in the vw_play folder. Requires a .wav file as input.

## How to run
Run ```bash install.sh``` to install all the requirements.
Run ```Make``` to create the executable.
Run ```./create_file``` to run the program.
